# testing_folder

in the command line when 'make' is entered, errors are dispalyed.  
This project is incomplete as there exists errors that I am not able to figure out. 
Desired output is not recieved from the code created. 
However tried to follow the instructions by .h, .c, structures/fucntions. user arguments, threads for producer, consumer. Unfortunately it was unsuccesful. 
Would love to learn about my mistakes.
